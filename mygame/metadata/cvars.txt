# below. For remote hotload to work, the webserver needs to be enabled, must have
# the port set to 9001, and remote_clients must be set to true.
# webserver.enabled=true
# webserver.port=9001
# webserver.remote_clients=true

# Should use the whole display
# equivalent to calling $gtk.set_window_fullscreen(true)
# Note: If you use this flag, you must provide a way to
#       exit full sceen mode from your game and wire it up
#       to $gtk.set_window_fullscreen(false)
# renderer.fullscreen=true
